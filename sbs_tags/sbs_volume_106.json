The operating room is free, so he can attack by extending his sword or creating a strong impact in it. K is for \"knife\", it's K.\n\nThe \"R\" in another awakening technique \"R\u30fbROOM\" means \"remote\". It's a remote ROOM. Previously, as a surgeon, Law had to be inside the operation room, but with the awakening of the [[Ope Ope no Mi]], this is no longer necessary. If it's confusing, the atmosphere is fine! (laugh)",
