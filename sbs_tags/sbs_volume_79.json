''(Sa Kokode Chotto Minasan Kitekudasai!)''\n\nSKCMK Time!!\n\nSo about birthdays, you know how everyone is just kind of randomly making them up as we go? I mean it's fine, since I don't really give a damn about them anyways (yikes, I said it).\u00a0\n\nThe thing is though, I recently had one of my staff members look up all of the character birth dates we've decided on throughout the years. The results? A ''Birthday Calendar'', which I've included in the back of this volume. Please check it out. (Page 190)\n\nAlright! Crap, I never realized there were so many overlapping birthdays!! ''(shock)'' I've even received several letters in the past mentioning things like \"None of the characters have my birthday\". I see.\n\n..So, what I'm trying to say is... LET'S FILL THIS CALENDAR IN!!\n\nWhy don't we make it possible for all One Piece readers around the world to be able to say that they share a birthday with so and so character?\n\nAnd by the way, here's a disclaimer:\n\nI WON'T CHECK A SINGLE ONE OF THESE BIRTHDAYS!! Please just come up with plausible explanations on your own as for why a certain character should have that certain birthday, even if it's a stretch. It's likely they'll easily be affirmed without any trouble, as usual-\n\nSince I really don't give a damn about this stuff!!\n\nThis calendar is the latest version as of October 2015, but I'm sure the blanks will start to fill out soon enough as the volumes keep getting released. You can always write these new birthdays in on your own, or go to ONE PIECE.com to check out the birthday calendar that we'll make sure to keep updated. For anyone who would like the decide on a character's birthday, I'd love it if you went on our website and sent us your suggestions by checking the blank boxes on this online birthday calendar.

Don't you think you'd be less likely to jeopardize your life in the next fight if you used \"Fujitora's kneel of apology\" instead? (laughs) Anyways, yes, you are correct about the Japanese Nio statue! I know that there are all kinds of things that symbolize power around the world, but I decided to stick to my homeland for this one and pick up some inspiration from an age-old representation of Japanese strength. Can't wait to see Gear 4 come out in figurines and the anime!\n\n[[File:SBS79_6_Shirts.png|thumb|75px]]",
