If he doesn't like it, we fight, or I rename it.\n\n*Step 6: Master Copy\n\nCall the assistants over to my house, and we go nuts for 2 or 3 days. We draw the master copy.\n\n*Step 7: [[Jump]] goes on Sale\n\nJump goes on sale around the country.\n\n*Step 8: Meeting\n\nNow I talk with the high-tech boss Y-san about the cover of the book and how to color it.\n\n*Step 9: Make the Extras\n\nDraw the cover pages and make the [[SBS]].\n\n*Step 10: Book goes on Sale\n\nIt's already complete a full month before it's available in stores. The end.\n\nSo this is basically how it works. Well, this is my schedule, but all artists have their own pace.
