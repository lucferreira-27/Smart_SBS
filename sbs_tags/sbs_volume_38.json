After that, it's just a nasty old fruit. In the instance that they take a bite at the same time, the power will belong to the one who swallows first. Nothing will happen if anyone else takes a bite. So in summation, a single fruit cannot give its powers to multiple people.\n\n[[File:SBS Vol.38 01.png|thumb|160px|Longfish: Pound it out!!]]",

There are several different accounts, but in general there was a lying, no-good pirate named Davy Jones, a greedy deck chief who was famous for putting all the crew's valuables in his own locker. He was so wicked, even for a pirate, that one day the Devil himself cursed Davy to live at the bottom of the sea forever, swabbing the deck of a sunken ship and placing all the sunken treasure into his locker, where it would never be seen again. So when pirates say \"Put 'im in Davy Jones' locker!!\" it means \"sink 'im to the bottom o' the sea!!\"",

How about a nice summer beach on a Spring Island.\n*[[Sanji]]: Personally, I'll take a Robin-chan on a Nami-san Island! Ooohoo!\n*[[Usopp]]: Are you stupid, that's not a choice!! So anyways, I think... summer on an Autumn Island would be best for developing weapons! While fishing.\n*[[Tony Tony Chopper|Chopper]]: I can't stand the heat... I like the spring on a Winter Island!!\n*[[Nico Robin|Robin]]: I suppose I'd take an autumn on a Spring Island, good weather for reading and relaxing.\n*Luffy: OK!! I made my choice!!
