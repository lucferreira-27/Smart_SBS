Anyways, I suppose you're feeling a bit guilty because you're looking at my characters with lecherous eyes XD. This is just my personal opinion regarding all of the characters I've ever created... but in all honestly, it doesn't really bother me. One of my own great teachers told me once: everything within \"the world of manga\" is pretty much just merchandise. Nobody within that world is real, and it wouldn't be very professional of a creator to get offended over whatever a customer decides to do with the goods he has bought. I feel just about the same way. You're free to your own interpretations, fantasies, and any other methods of enjoyment. It makes me happy just knowing that you even care to follow along with my series at all.",

These \"number puns\", known as \"goro awase\" (\u30b4\u30ed\u5408\u308f\u305b), use the various methods of counting that exist within the Japanese language to turn normal terms into numbers. For example, above, the word for \"freely\" (Jiyuni \u81ea\u7531\u306b) sounds like the word for \"twelve\" (jyuni \u5341\u4e8c), hence \"freely\" can be written as \"12\".
