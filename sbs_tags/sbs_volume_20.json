You're that former One Piece editor with a weakness for cute things, working for a certain Jump editorial department, Da-asa or Asada or whatever, right?! You, sir, are relentless. And now you're sending business questions to the SBS via email?! This is supposed to be sacred ground for my readers... ah, well. Oh but, thanks for helping me out for those 4 years. In any case, since OTHER people have asked this too, I'll answer it. The bottom row, starting from the left, is [[Cowboy]], [[Bourbon Jr.]], [[Karoo]], [[Kentauros]], and [[Hikoichi]]. The top row is [[Stomp]] and [[Ivan X]] . That's all. I had the names all established, but putting them all in the manga would be too hard to figure out, so I decided not to.",
