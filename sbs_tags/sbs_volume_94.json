The format of \"Animal + 1 character doing XX\" is a pretty basic one. It's always good to have a lot of Strawhats. When I first started, I thought to myself I would try to reply to as many requests as I could! At least that's what I thought. I wanted to fulfill 1 request per person but eventually I started to think about how many skilled artists are out there and realized: \"I want to draw this, but I wonder if its already been drawn before\". Eventually I decided that I would instead draw what I wanted to draw most. These requests about animals and characters always made me feel that I wanted to see it drawn so I would be able to fulfill these requests happily. Art is still my hobby after all. Even for the two-page colour spreads I always think to myself, \"I want to draw this!\" before it manages to get drawn. These often feature animals too. I've already been doing this for 22 years after all so most of the usual illustration ideas have been done. When I see a new and fresh request, it makes it fun for me to draw as well.",
