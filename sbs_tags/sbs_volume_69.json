In this case, your current user, Magellan, covers your body with poison, and becomes immune to all types of poisons, in addition to providing a kind of protection against physical attacks.

Basically, they're just running so incredibly fast that you can see the afterimages of their legs and they end up looking like they have multiple legs. As for the name, I shall name this move the \"''DabaDabaDash''\". The way to use it is to simply, move your legs at an expeditious rate.
