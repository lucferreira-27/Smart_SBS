In class the other day, I learned that the word \"Rob\" stands for \"steal\". So I got curious, and after searching, learned that \"Lucci\" means \"light\" in Italian. Put them together, it's \"steal the light\". I thought it was fascinating, because \"stealing\" is a concept that runs throughout One Piece, not just in this part. So you must have named him that on purpose, right? P.N. Refect",

Eyewitness tales about the unbelievable islands, people and happenings in this mysterious sea, related by fearless explorers, all so outlandish and bizarre to normal readers around the world that they were collected in a book of tall tales and given this humiliating title. If this book only exists today because the brave scholars of [[Ohara]] gave their lives to protect it 20 years ago, it fills your heart with something warm.
