I think of these pages as being created by me together with the artists who entertain the readers. Having a picture published isn't the goal - I want your published pictures to entertain the readers. Art should be born to entertain.<br />That's why I'll publish someone over and over if they're good. On the other hand, I won't give anyone the prize twice. It's always fun to choose pictures.",

I first met him in the theater where Luffy's seiyuu Tanaka Mayumi works, and - wow, ''powerful''! His name is \"Imamura Norio\"-san, but I thought his face looked so much like a rock, so I mistakenly remembered it as \"Iwamura\" (iwa = rock), and then I started calling him \"Iva-san\". What surprised me even more was that Imamura-san, who knew he was the model for Iva-san, went to the seiyuu audition for the anime and brilliantly scored his part. In other words, the real okama who inspired the creation of Iva-san, Imamura Norio-san, is right now playing the part of Iva-san in the TV anime. He's ''powerful''!",
