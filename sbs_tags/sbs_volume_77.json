Well I'll be starting it nevertheless.\n\nGuys guys, hear me out for a bit!! Take a look \u2192\n\nThis is a work of art that was submitted and featured as part of the Usopp Gallery Pirates segment in volume 23. ---and then, there's this super popular series that's currently being published in the Shonen Jump magazines called \"[[Wikipedia:My Hero Academia|My Hero Academia]]\". Take a look at the authors.\n\n[[File:SBS77 1 My Hero Academia.png|thumb|left|150px]]\n\n<span style=\"font-size:1.5em\">\u2190\u2192THEY'RE THE SAME!!!</span>\n\nThis is volume 23 we're talking about, so I guess that makes it around 10 years ago? The same person who, as a boy, submitted this postcard, is now a widely recognized and extremely successful professional mangaka himself!! Not only that, but his work actually ended up being serialized in the Shonen Jump magazine right alongside \"ONE PIECE\" itself!! This news gives me ecstatic joy. You see, a bit back at the Jump new years event, he himself actually came forward and told me about this. You should've told me earlier, I would've totally rooted for you!!\n\nWith that being said, please go and check out Kohei Horikoshi-sensei's series \"My Hero Academia\"!!",

While this is in fact straight up Cora-san's code name, it can be said that there isn't really a problem with the captain of the \"Heart Pirates\" wearing this coat either. Even speaking ability-wise, Law is a \"death surgeon\" known with his unique skill of cutting peoples' \"hearts\" out. While to society, it may seem like a symbol of fear and power, I'm quite positive that Law himself had \"Cora-san\" in mind. It's definitely custom made.\n\n[[File:SBS77 3 Rosinante.png|thumb|150px]]",
