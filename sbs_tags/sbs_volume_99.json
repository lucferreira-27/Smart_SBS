That's why Gifters with the same animal exist and why ability users for \u201c[[Logia]]\u201d, \u201c[[Paramecia]]\u201d, or \u201c[[Zoan#Mythical Zoan|Mythical Zoans]]\u201d cannot appear, since lineage factors can only be extracted from already existing organisms.

When you think of a centaur, you usually think of a muscular beefy guy, so I wanted to make this one a sexy girl, but I felt that wouldn't be possible with horse-like legs, so by making the thighs look more human-like, they made her look more beautiful, though her laughing face is like that of a horse. It's so gap moe.\n\n[[File:SBS99 Hamlet.png|thumb|150px]]\nNumber two! The face of how to grow your fruit in a weird way, it's Hamlet!! His giraffe is always trembling and struggling to remain standing, yet despite having become a failure of a living creature, his speech is brimming with a noble prince-like confidence. You just can't help but love him.{{-}}\n\n{{Gallery|position=center\n|SBS99 Holed'em.png|\n|SBS99 Future Robot Daltanious.png|\n|SBS99 Daltanious.png|\n}}\n\nAnd finally, number 1 is\u2026!! With a lion in his belly, it's [[Holed'em]]! It's no exaggeration to say that SMILEs originated from wanting to draw this guy. A long while ago, there was this robot anime called [[wikipedia:Future Robot Daltanious|''Future Robot Daltanious'']]. There a lion robot and a humanoid robot would transform and dock together, becoming a robot with a lion face on its chest!! It's something I also loved as a child because of how cool it was. I always thought \"How I wish I was made of ''ch\u014dg\u014dkin'' robot alloy so I could transform just like him~!\", so my longing came into form here!! Haha\u2026 oh, talking about this I remembered, I also really loved this centaur robot called ''Daibajin'', so I wonder if that's why I like Umami? Yeah, SMILEs are all like dockable robots!!
