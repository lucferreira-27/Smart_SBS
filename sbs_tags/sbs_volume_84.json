After the incident 13 years ago, Law wandered into the next town over on [[Swallow Island]], crying his eyes out.\n*[[Shachi]] and [[Penguin]] were snotty little kids growing up on [[Swallow Island]] in the [[North Blue]].\n*Fourteen years ago, [[Bepo]] left [[Zou]] in search of his older brother, got on a ship to the North Blue, and wound up on Swallow Island a year later.\n*On the edge of town, Law spotted two young ruffians picking on a polar bear. When they turned on him next, he ended up beating them and saving the polar bear. Ultimately, all three of them wound up respecting and following him.\n\n[[File:SBS84 Heart.png|200px|right]]\n**[[Trafalgar D.

Eventually, the four of them founded the Heart Pirates together. So the answer to your question is \"at the same time\"! You won't see this in the manga!",
