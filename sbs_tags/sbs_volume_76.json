This is the reason why there wasn't a single woman in his crew when they arrived in the \"Summit War Arc\". He was prepared for \"death\" at this point. He had ripped off all of the medical tools that were helping him stablize his condition despite his illness, left the women of his medical team, who desperately tried to stop him, in a safe place while tearing up, and went back out into sea for battle with just his boys!!
