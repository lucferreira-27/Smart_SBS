When I'm writing childrens' conversations, AKA, stupid Luffy's conversations, I deliberately reduce the amount of kanji used in the lines and opt to write more words in hiragana. That's because I feel that writing something even the speaker himself wouldn't really understand clearly in kanji is somewhat unnatural. In the same way, for the fish-men, \"The Sun\" is something that they would never be able to see unless they swim 10,000 meters up to the surface. It's just not a part of their everyday lives. In short, it is something that they yearn for without really understanding. Therefore, rather than the use of kanji, the katakana version \"\u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\" suits the word better for me in this context. \"The Sun Pirates\" (\u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u6d77\u8cca\u56e3). It's the awkward naming I enjoy.\n\n''Translator's Note: Katakana is a limited alphabet with the same amount of letters as hiragana (46). It is one of the three alphabets that the children of Japan learn prior to kanji, which in contrary, has an infinite number of characters (which it's list is still being revised) that stand for several things and is even more complicated to write as well. While hiragana (and eventually kanji where appropriate) is the standard, katakana is typically used in Japanese text when portraying foreign terms, concepts, or speakers.''",
