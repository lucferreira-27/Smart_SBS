Amazingly enough, even I, the author, had no idea in which countries One Piece is published. So, I asked the [[Wikipedia:Shueisha|Shueisha]] publishing's international department to investigate for me. Thanks to everyone that helped. Below is the list of countries and languages that One Piece is published in as of October 2002. You will definitely not be able to buy these versions in Japan.\n\nThere are eleven Countries:\n{|width=\"100%\" align=\"center|-\"\n|width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*[[One Piece in Taiwan|Taiwan]] (Mandarin)\n*[[One Piece in Korea|Korea]] (Korean)\n*[[One Piece in Singapore|Singapore]](Mandarin)\n*[[One Piece in France|France]] (French)\n*[[One Piece in Spain|Spain]] (Spanish)\n*[[One Piece in Brazil|Brazil]] (Portuguese)\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*[[One Piece in China|Hong Kong]] (Cantonese)\n*[[One Piece in Thailand|Thailand]] (Thai)\n*[[One Piece in Malaysia|Malaysia]] (Malay)\n*[[One Piece in Italy|Italy]] (Italian)\n*[[One Piece in Germany|Germany]] (German)\n|}\nThere are four more countries that plan to publish One Piece in 2003:\n{|width=\"100%\" align=\"center|-\"\n|width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*[[One Piece in Indonesia|Indonesia]] (Indonesian)\n*[[One Piece in Sweden|Sweden]] (Swedish)\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*[[One Piece in Denmark|Denmark]] (Danish)\n*[[One Piece in Latin America|Mexico]] (Spanish)\n|}\nThat's what I heard.
