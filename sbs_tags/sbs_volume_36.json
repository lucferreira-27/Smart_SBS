That's when lightning reaches down to the ground.\n\n[[File:SBS36 5 Yamada.png|thumb|right|90px|Yamada]]\nIt's like when you hear \"Lightning just fell on that tree!\" Or \"Yamada just got hit by lightning!!\" That's called discharge. However, discharge doesn't always have to occur outside the clouds. Sometimes the lightning starts zapping around within the clouds. This is called \"curtain discharge\" or \"curtain lightning\". Gold conducts electricity, so when Luffy thrust that golden ball into the Raig\u014d, the lightning all zapped through it and disappeared. But Luffy didn't really understand what it was that he did. It's all OK. Just remember, everything cleared up. And today, Skypiea is at peace.\n\nTHE SBS IS OVER!!",
