Now, to start, I realize I only put it into one little panel, but they honestly do exist. By which I mean, rainbows ARE circles. Fig. 1: Rainbows (Sun), Water Screen, Reflection of 42 degrees! Fig. 2: This might be hard to understand in the picture, but a rainbow is formed when light from the sun is refracted through water droplets into bands of color. Unless the three elements to the left (sun, water, human) are placed exactly in the circumstances shown, you can't see a rainbow. The angle that light refracts into colors of visible light is at 42 degrees. Because humans are standing on the ground, the lower half of the circle is blocked by the horizon. Therefore, seeing a rainbow in the sky above from sea would be nearly impossible on Earth, but since this was the Grand Line, I figured maybe it would happen. When I was talking to a mangaka friend of mine, he said he saw a round rainbow while flying on a plane, so according to theory, it should work if you're in the air. I suppose you might even see one from the roof of your school. Hey, what is this, a science textbook?! Don't worry, folks, we're returning you to your normally scheduled dumb manga, One Piece!
