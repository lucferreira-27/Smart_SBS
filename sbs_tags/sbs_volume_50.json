When I drew Sanji vs Kalifa (Chapter 403), some people lauded Sanji's stance, and some people felt sorry for him. The truth is, I didn't really want to write those lines. Sanji doesn't have a \"policy\" of not kicking women; the truth is that he actually CAN'T kick them. He is a very proud man. I think he was really frustrated at that. think Nami recognized that, and chose to praise him for once. It's a scene that I hope will resonate with male readers, but everyone's free to take it as they wish. Also, Zeff is just a man among men.",

In fact, this is a great time to explain that I went to the great anime authority Kohei Tanaka-san to write the music for me ahead of time, because when it came around to the anime, I didn't want the lyrics I wrote to\nmess up the guys who had to turn that song into music. I told him, \"I'm going to do [[Thriller Bark]] in a year or so,\" and it only took what, like four or five years? Ha ha. Well, it took an hour or so, but he managed to make the lyrics from Chapter 488 (The Song of Life) match up. At first, it had a frightening sound, but by changing the performance, it became funny. Therefore, Thriller Bark owes a great debt to the incredible Kohei \"Genius\" Tanaka. Hope you like the anime! I was actually hoping to get the song in school textbooks, but since it had \"sake\" in it, I had to give up on that. I hope you all sing it, just the same. And now, END THE SBS!!
