For this [[katana]], the \"level\" is \"O-Wazamono\", the \"make\" is \"White-Painted Scabbard Long Sword\" (this is a type of outward appearance for swords. It means the scabbard is painted white), and the \"blade\" is a \"straight edge\".\n\n*For swords, the levels go down from Saijo-O-Wazamono, O-Wazamono, Ryo-Wazamono, Wazamono, and then normal swords. A Wazamonos means it's an excellent blade. When they say \"12 Saijo-O-Wazamono\", it means there are 12 blades in the world that are considered the very best.\u00a0\n\n*There are two types of blade edges:\u00a0''suguha\u00a0''or\u00a0\"straight edge\"(2),\u00a0and ''midareba\u00a0''or\u00a0\"unravelled edge\"(3).
