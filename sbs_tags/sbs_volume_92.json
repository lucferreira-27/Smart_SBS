It was a situation of \"Our staff\" VS \"Readers\" (LOL). In Wano, because all the store signs and embellishments are in Japanese, I needed to come up with words to fill them all. It was really hard to come up with what words to tell my artists to write in for each one so I asked them to just hide words related to [ONE PIECE] around the background. In that same panel, you can see [\u8e0a\u96c0\u4f0d\u95a2] (Jumping Sparrow Five Gate), [\u96f9\u4e09\u6d77\u95a2] (Hail Three Sea Gate) and [\u6d77\u56db\u6012\u95a2] (Sea Four Angry Gate) written as well. So what do you think these are related to? (LOL). There are probably more words hidden in other panels as well!!",
