Yes, there are times when I put a lot of effort into chapter titles. When I find a really good title, it can pump me up sometimes, but since it's all part of my same work, I don't think there's much use in going on about this title or that. It's enough for me to know that there are people out there who like them. I'll have plenty more fun with them.\n\n\n[[File:SBS39 5 Nami's Secret Compartment.png|thumb]]",
