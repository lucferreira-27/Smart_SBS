Well, I say that, but I do nothing but draw manga. I noticed this when we were drawing it, but if Luffy had a nosebleed when he saw Hancock's body, I think you would all be like \"Ehh!?\". That's not the Luffy we know. I believe that Luffy reacted to Nami's naked body twice, in volumes 18 and 23, and both times it happened, Usopp was with him! He's the suspicious one! In other words, when Luffy is alone, his reaction is what it was with Hancock. He's interested, but he's not entranced by her. But when he's with Usopp, who's the same age, it's like a kid on a school trip: his bad side comes out!! Yeah, both sides of Luffy feel right to me, so the culprit is definitely Usopp!!",

But after I said that in [[SBS Volume 53#Chapter 520, Page 168|Volume 53]], I got a mountain of postcards like this, so I was surprised. There's no deep meaning behind it! Um, first, when I was talking about an ideal length of publication, I was thinking about the readers who have to buy all of the books. As an author, I always want new readers, but people who started reading in the middle, for example, might not know that Luffy was the first member of the Straw Hat Pirates. [[File:SBS54 4 Romance Dawn.png|right|120px]] I want them to know what kind of adventures they had and the friends they made along the way, but I can't just tell them to buy more than 50 books, right!? Even I know that kids don't have that kind of money! To deal with this and let people know the past story, we've made several summary books. But this time, My desire to make it as cheap as possible has been granted by two companies, \"Caramel Mama\" and \"Hearty Way!\" It's too cheap!! Because it's free!! Nice fight, guys!! They've made a site called \"[http://www.j-onepiece.com ONE PIECE WEB]\"! It has a perfect story guide. It explains the entire past story!! kids who can't afford all of the books can just go to this site! Access it! (Adults, you go buy the books, please.) So when I said that before, it was because I was worried about this, so I apologize. It's not like I'm losing my passion. I've only wanted to do one thing from the beginning, and that's to tell lots of stories and make an interesting manga until the end. In the big picture, One Piece is roughly in its middle third. If you have time, please stay with us. I'll always fight to make a story unlike any you've read before. And check out the website too!!",
