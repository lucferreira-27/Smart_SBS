Also, the words he uses (hiyashi SBS) is yet another pun since this overlaps with the \"hiyashi chuka\" mentioned above. Finally, this may be a triple pun since winter is cold''.",

Vice Admiral Strawberry has appeared on several occasions such as the buster call in Enies Lobby and the Whitebeard war, as I recall, but on those occasions he has been wearing a hat, I believe. Although we would think \"Oh what a long hat\", in the recent flashback of Fish-Man Island, it was shown how the bandages on his head twisted up to the top. In other words, yes. Strawberry is a person with a long head. It isn't his hair that is long. A \"long-headed human\" with a lo~ng skull is the correct answer. He is very good at headbutts.\n\n[[File:SBS64 3 Ikaros.png|100px|right]]",
