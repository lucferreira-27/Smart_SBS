One Piece [[volumes]] come out in a repeating order that goes, \"2 months\", \"2 months\", then \"3 months\". So if you say, \"There haven't been any for 3 months!\" can you tell when the next two will come out?! Good.\n\nO-II: Oh yeah, I forgot. I noticed two mistakes of my own in Volume 21. So I'll correct them for you now. First of all, the answer to the Culprit Quiz right before Chapter 190. I forgot to include the answer. It's \"Crocus-san\". The other one is the title art for the SBS. I drew Crocus and Laboon for Volume 18, but then I drew them again. I was just under a spell of Crocus Fever in Volume 21. What's that? Am I reflecting on my mistakes? Sure sure, I am, don't worry. (*picking his nose*). Okay, let's continue the SBS.",

A long time ago, there were men in Japan called \"wakou\" who were basically \"pirates\". This \"Wakou\" would get into their boats and raid the Korean peninsula and Chinese mainland. Sometimes in your textbooks, it talks about \"expeditionary forces\" to Korea, but those were really pirates. They were there to loot and plunder and all that. Yeah, they were bad guys. There's also another famous group of people around the Seto Inland Sea called \"Murakami Suigun (Navy)\" who were basically pirates. They have been a big influence on Japan throughout history, though they don't get widespread recognition. A long time ago, I was researching the differences between \"wakou\" and \"suigun\", but there were \"suigun\" who were called \"wakou\", so I got the impression that there's no need to even draw a distinction. In short, Japan has had a lot of \"pirates\".",
