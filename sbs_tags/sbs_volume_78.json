Uhh, in other words,\u00a0I gave him that name because I felt like I couldn't not reference the word when it came to drawing about hardboiledness. If it interests you, please go look it up.

Crocodile was 30 at the time.\n\nSimilar to Luffy, back when he was young, Crocodile's name spread across the seas with incredible momentum, but soon after he was admitted into the Shichibukai in his mid-20's, he tried to fight Whitebeard and was completely and utterly crushed by him.\n\nThough he seemingly calmed down at this point, his eyes became set on the kingdom of Alabasta, and it happened to be precisely during this time period that he was being featured in the papers as a hero who hunted down pirates. In other words, that was an article reporting the acts of heroism by Crocodile at the time!",

Well done with your findings.\n\nX Drake, along with Luffy and the others, is a member of the youthful \"Worst Generation\" of pirates that stirred up a great deal of commotion around the world. His father, Barrels, used to be a Marine Officer and Drake admired this, dreaming of becoming a great Marine just like him one day. However; who knows what happened, but his father suddenly turned into a pirate and became a terrible man who would physically abuse even his own son. Drake, who still believed in his past father and followed him around was aged 19 at this time (13 and a half years ago). Though that's a bit too old to be calling him a boy, he probably seemed to look a lot younger while he was weakened with the fear of his father. Later, he fatefully crossed paths with Law, and the Marines soon took custody of him, leading Drake to become a Marine. The thing is, as if resigning himself to fate, after Drake made his way all the way up to becoming a Rear Admiral in the Marines, he ended up leaving the navy and becoming a pirate himself!!\n\nJust what happened? What's he thinking? Hey, you!! ---come onnnnnn.\n\nI'm interested in seeing the future of Drake, who has also made an appearance in a cover series!!",

Though it wasn't published by companies like Shueisha or Jump, I heard that this person debuted under the penname \"Keita Himuro\" in a magazine called \"[[Wikipedia:Monthly Afternoon|Monthly Afternoon]]\" this year! Congratulations! I'd love to see this person get one of his works serialized and for him to make a name for himself in the great sea that is the Manga World! You've got this!!
