Pretty cool, huh?\n\nNow, about a real \"sailing ceremony\":\n\n* Before they begin building the ship, there is a \"building ceremony\".\n* Once the ship is fully built, there is a \"completion ceremony\".\n* And when it finally goes to sea, there is a grand \"sailing ceremony\".\n\nIn other words, the \"sailing ceremony\" is the biggest and most exciting celebration of the birth of a ship. To celebrate, you break a bottle of liquor on the bow of the ship, and if the bottle doesn't break, the ship is cursed with bad luck. It's a time of celebration, but the person who actually does the breaking has to take it seriously. I've even heard that in Viking \"sailing ceremonies\" they spilled blood on the ship from a live sacrifice.
