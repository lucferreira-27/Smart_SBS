But the three-month breaks have been more often recently, I admit. The reason is that because I sometimes take breaks from Jump (in which I do other work instead), it means I don't end up with enough chapters to put out a volume in two months. From now on, you should probably assume it will be three-month waits with an occasional two months. Also, while I'm at it, I'm going to announce that the other thing I mentioned in the SBS about having 11-chapter volumes will no longer occur. About the previous volume, they increased the price slightly on all the Jump volumes. At the same time, they told me that fitting in 11 chapters would mean a 20-yen bump. If you end up paying 20 more yen for a volume, it's not as much of a bonus anymore, is it? So in the future, there will only be 10 chapters in a volume, max.

Of course, some of you may think that because Dragon Ball had only 42 volumes, that I passed it long ago, but as that was started as a gag manga originally, it only has 15 pages per chapter. One Piece is a story manga with 19-page chapters, so after the same 12 years, I end up with 53 volumes instead. Sorry for costing you more money! I'm hoping to finally getting around to finishing One Piece, but as I'd hate to leave this expansive story I've created without a proper ending, I'm afraid it will just have to keep going for a bit.",
